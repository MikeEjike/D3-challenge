              Welcome to the newsroom! You've just accepted a data visualization
              position for a major metro paper. You're tasked with analyzing the
              current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts,
              graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand your
              findings. The editor wants to run a series of feature stories
              about the health risks facing particular demographics. She's
              counting on you to sniff out the first story idea by sifting
              through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral
              Risk Factor Surveillance System. The data set included with the
              assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates:
              https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml,
              but you are free to investigate a different data set. The current
              data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc.
              by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."
            </p>
            <p>
              Using the D3 techniques we taught you in class, create a scatter
              plot that represents each state with circle elements. You'll code
              this graphic in the app.js file of your homework directoryâ€”make
              sure you pull in the data from data.csv by using the d3.csv
              function. Your scatter plot should ultimately appear like the
              image at the top of this section.
